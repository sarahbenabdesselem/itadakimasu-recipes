        <h3>Description:</h3>
        </br>
        <p><strong>Okonomiyaki</strong> is most compared to the Western dishes of pancakes, pizza,<br>and omelettes. While at first glance it would seem that these dishes have<br>almost nothing in common with each other, I have a feeling the comparison<br>stems from the freedom of being able to be creative with the toppings<br>and ingredients of these dishes. In fact, <strong>Okonomiyaki</strong> is a combination of<br>the words <strong>Okonomi</strong>, meaning <em>what you like</em> or <em>what you want</em>, and <strong>yaki</strong><br>meaning <em>grilled</em> or <em>cooked</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Okonomiyaki</strong> is generally easy to make, though it requires a fair bit of prep-work<br>before it’s ready to cook. Many items must be chopped and at the ready because<br>once all the ingredients are prepared, it can be quickly thrown together. <strong>Fluffy</strong><br>and <strong>smothered</strong> in salty tonkatsu sauce and creamy Japanese mayonaise,<br>with bursts of picked ginger and seafood within, it’s no wonder that this dish<br>is referred to as <em>Osaka soul food…</em>.</p>
        <h3>The Recipe:</h3>
        <h2>Okonomiyaki</h2>
        <p>Makes 3 medium or 2 large okonomiyaki (2 plus servings).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces grated nagaimo</li>
            <li>5 tbsp dashi stock, or water with a pinch of dashi powder</li>
            <li>½ cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 tbsp beni shouga</li>
            <li>2 cups packed cabbage, roughly and thinly chopped</li>
            <li>12 medium shrimp, halved horizontally and lengthwise</li>
            <li>3 tbsp chopped green onion</li>
            <li>Oil for cooking</li>
            <li>Toppings: kizami nori, aonori, katsuobushi, tonkatsu sauce,<br>and Japanese mayonnaise</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and grate the nagaimo, avoiding contact with raw surface if allergic.<br>Mix with the dashi and flour, and add two of the eggs. It should be a rather<br>loose batter. (Optional: fry up some tenkatsu with a small portion of the batter.)</li>
            <li>Add the chopped cabbage to the batter. Add the other egg. Stir with a big<br>spoon or a spatula to combine. Add the beni shouga, shrimp and green onion.</li>
            <li>Place oil in large frying pan over medium-low heat. Take a wad of cotton wool<br>or paper towels, and spread around a thin layer of oil.</li>
            <li>Spread ½ to ⅓ of the batter in a circle on the pan. Put on a lid and let it<br>steam-cook for about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take two spatulas and flip the okonomiyaki over carefully. Continue cooking<br>without a lid for about 3 to 4 minutes. Lower the heat if it’s cooking too fast,<br>or turn it up a bit if it isn’t. The inside should be just cooked through, not doughy<br>or runny. Try to resist the urge to press down on the okonomiyaki at this point-doing<br>so will squeeze some air and fluffiness out of the okonomiyaki.</li>
            <li>Remove from frying pan and serve on a large plate. Brush with okonomiyaki<br>or tonkatsu sauce and drizzle with Japanese mayonnaise. Sprinkle on katsuobushi<br>and kizami nori liberally. Eat while piping hot.</li>
